A5Q1 https://editor.p5js.org/john.hart/sketches/0HVmD5QGf Desc: Using an array and a constructor, this code creates 5 bubble sprites with
their own sizes and locations on the canvas, and the jitter function causes their positions to change rapidly. Was revised once I realised
the jitter part was not in my initial sketch
A5Q2 https://editor.p5js.org/john.hart/sketches/uev-dpfsG Desc: Editing the code from sketch one, this creates bubbles in the same style but
in a quantity of 50.
