A5Q1 https://editor.p5js.org/john.hart/sketches/0HVmD5QGf Desc: Using an array and a constructor, this code creates 5 bubble sprites with
their own sizes and locations on the canvas, and the jitter function causes their positions to change rapidly. Was revised once I realised
the jitter part was not in my initial sketch
A5Q2 https://editor.p5js.org/john.hart/sketches/uev-dpfsG Desc: Editing the code from sketch one, this creates bubbles in the same style but
in a quantity of 50.
A5Q3 https://editor.p5js.org/john.hart/sketches/R_iZNKvpS Desc: Reutilizing the bubbles from the past sketches, this is a revamped aquarium simulation 
using 2 new arrays for breeders and catchers represented by pirahnas and salmon, the pihranas disappearing after being eaten by the salmon (originally
had it other way around)
A5Q4 https://editor.p5js.org/john.hart/sketches/lztZf4kW- Desc: New iteration of the simulation with the breeders having improved nonlinear movement
in the canvas, detecting collision with the wall and bouncing off of it. attempted to add capabiity for breeders to multiply upon collision but
did not work.
